IV- Changes for Microlua developers
===================================

V- Comments
===========

This is a (very) small bug fix version resulting from updating the version of Lua that MicroLua uses. Some functions were removed and the oldest code of 'libs.lua' was still using them. The part of the code that needed to be fixed passed through our tests ;)
It looks like I will make some comments for every new version from now on ahah! I love talking. To unkonwn people that will never answer me. Or maybe will I never be read. :'(
