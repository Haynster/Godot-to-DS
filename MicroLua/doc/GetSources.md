This page explains how to get MicroLua's sources.

Static packages
===============

If you only wish to customize a bit your MicroLua from the inside, you may not want to clone the entire repository with Git.  
If this is the case, then you simple need to download the sources [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/microlua/files/Sources/).

The tutorial about compiling MicroLua is on [this page](Compile).

These packages are only made for medium versions, like 'MicroLua 4.6' so they are not really up to date unlike the Git repository.


Using Git content tracker
=========================

The best way to get always up to date sources is to clone the repository using [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

Please refer to [this page](Git) to learn how to use Git.

When your local repository is set up, running `git pull` will get the latest version.
