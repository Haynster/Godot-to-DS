Welcome to MicroLua!
====================


This wiki will help you to get any information you need about MicroLua.


You should choose a section following your status: are you a gamer or user or MicroLua, a homebrew developer or are you someone who is interested in improving MicroLua?

In any case, I'm sure this [page full of links](GeneralLinks) will be useful. If you feel helpful today, you can also learn [how to contribute](Contribute).


Users and gamers
----------------

If you seek details about installing MicroLua, which is as simple as copying some files on your cartridge like any other homebrew, you should have a look at the [installation instructions](Installation).

For general informations and for getting the best homebrews you can enjoy with ÂµLua, the best place is [the official forum](http://microlua.xooit.fr), or you can look at [the known projects](MicroLuaProjects). The forum will also provide the best answers for any of your problems.

Finally, if you want to learn more about MicroLua in general, read [this page](MicroLua).

        
Homebrew developers
-------------------

The links from the previous section may be quite useful for you too.

Afterwards, I guess the first thing you need is the documentation about the features MicroLua provides. You can find all its versions on [this page](APIDocumentation). There are also some tutorials available [there](Tutorials).

One question you may ask is: "can I test my scripts on my computer?" And the answer is: yes you can. Have a look either at using [DeSmuME](DeSmuME) or [MicroLua Simulator](MicroLuaSimulator) for this. For other tools you may use, read [this page](DevTools).

Finally, [this page](DevLinks) gathers a lot of good links for MicroLua homebrew developers.


MicroLua developers
-------------------

If you are looking at this, I'm sure the two previous sections could also be very instructive for you.

First of all, you need to know:

1. [how to get the sources](GetSources)
* [how to compile the sources](Compile)

Now you are quite free to do more or less anything you want while it goes in the good direction. A good idea is to take care of some [issues](https://sourceforge.net/p/microlua/tickets/), or look at the [suggestions](http://microlua.xooit.fr/f15-Suggestions.htm) on the forum.
